JudoShiai software helps you to arrange judo tournaments. 
JudoShiai consists of the following programs:

* JudoShiai: Tournament planning, drawing, and results printing.

For compilation you need the following software:

Linux (Ubuntu):
- Gnome development tools. In Ubuntu this is the gnome-devel
  software package.
- Open Office to export documents to PDF format. You have to create
  some macros that are described in the doc/Makefile.
- CheckInstall (http://www.asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/) 
  to create a Debian package.
- FMOD sound library (http://www.fmod.org/). Edit common/Makefile.inc to set
  the correct directory.
[- For Flash versions you need a haXe environment (http://haxe.org). (Not yet supported)]

Windows:

  Install the All-in-one bundle. Edit common/Makefile.inc to set
  the correct directory.

  ports of the GNU software for the Windows environment.
- Open Office to export documents to PDF format. You have to create
  some macros that are described in the doc/Makefile.

Go to the main level:
  cd judoshiai/trunk

a setup binary file:
