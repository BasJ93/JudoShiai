==============================================
RELEASE NOTE
VERSION 2.5a

This is the same version as 2.5 except the DLLs needed by Windows
are different. Ver 2.5 has newer DLLs with new features,
but unfortunately they cause problems with SVG rendering.
Ver 2.5a has older DLLs (same as 2.4) that work correctly.

It seems that the newest DLLs do not support XP any more.
Thus, for the time being, JudoShiai is stuck with the old versions.
Perhaps at some point Linux version will take its own development
path and have a better set of features.
